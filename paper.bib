    abstract = {Modern malware is designed with mutation characteristics, namely polymorphism and metamorphism, which causes an enormous growth in the number of variants of malware samples. Categorization of malware samples on the basis of their behaviors is essential for the computer security community, because they receive huge number of malware everyday, and the signature extraction process is usually based on malicious parts characterizing malware families. Microsoft released a malware classification challenge in 2015 with a huge dataset of near 0.5 terabytes of data, containing more than 20K malware samples. The analysis of this dataset inspired the development of a novel paradigm that is effective in categorizing malware variants into their actual family groups. This paradigm is presented and discussed in the present paper, where emphasis has been given to the phases related to the extraction, and selection of a set of novel features for the effective representation of malware samples. Features can be grouped according to different characteristics of malware behavior, and their fusion is performed according to a per-class weighting paradigm. The proposed method achieved a very high accuracy ($approx$ 0.998) on the Microsoft Malware Challenge dataset.},

	abstract="The number of malicious files detected every year are counted by millions. One of the main reasons for these high volumes of different files is the fact that, in order to evade detection, malware authors add mutation. This means that malicious files belonging to the same family, with the same malicious behavior, are constantly modified or obfuscated using several techniques, in such a way that they look like different files. In order to be effective in analyzing and classifying such large amounts of files, we need to be able to categorize them into groups and identify their respective families on the basis of their behavior. In this paper, malicious software is visualized as gray scale images since its ability to capture minor changes while retaining the global structure helps to detect variations. Motivated by the visual similarity between malware samples of the same family, we propose a file agnostic deep learning approach for malware categorization to efficiently group malicious software into families based on a set of discriminant patterns extracted from their visualization as images. The suitability of our approach is evaluated against two benchmarks: the MalImg dataset and the Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge dataset. Experimental comparison demonstrates its superior performance with respect to state-of-the-art techniques.",
