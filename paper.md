# Summary

Machine Learning for Malware Detection and Classification

``PE Extractor`` is a Python package for the preprocessing, the extraction of features and the visualization of Portable Executable files. 
``PE Extractor`` has been designed to provide a class-based and user-friendly interface for the extraction of well-known
features commonly used for the task of malware detection and classification such as byte and opcode N-Grams, API function calls, 
the registers usage, characteristics of the Portable Executable file sections, etcetera [@Pearson:2017], [@Pearson:2017]. In addition, ``PE Extractor``has various
command line tools to visualize the executables as grayscale images [@Pearson:2017]  or as a stream of entropy values (structural entropy) [@Pearson:2017].

``PE Extractor`` has been designed to be used by both computer security researchers and by students in courses on malware analysis,
machine learning and computer security. Currently, it has already been used in a number of scientific publications [@Pearson:2017]
